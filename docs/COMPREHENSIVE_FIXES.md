# Comprehensive Fixes for OZZ Radio Issues

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Background Image in AppDownloadSection**
**Problem**: Background image wasn't showing even when uploaded to Sanity
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the component to actually use the backgroundImage data
- Updated Sanity query to properly fetch background image with all fields
- Added proper background styling with overlay for better text readability

### 2. **Music Update Frequency**
**Problem**: Music information was updating every 30 seconds instead of real-time
**Solution**: 
- Changed update interval from 3000ms to 1000ms (1 second updates)
- This provides much more real-time track information updates

## üîß **Issues That Need Your Action**

### 3. **Music Stops When Navigating to Blog/News**
**Problem**: The radio player only exists on the home page, so music stops when navigating away

**Solutions (Choose One):**

#### **Option A: Global Persistent Player (Recommended)**
Add a persistent mini-player to the layout that stays active across all pages:

1. Create a global radio context
2. Add a mini-player to the main layout
3. Music continues playing across all pages

#### **Option B: Add Player to News Pages**
Add the radio player component to news pages so music continues there too.

### 4. **Blog Management Issues**

#### **Web Links in Articles**
**How to add links in Sanity:**
1. In your blog post editor, select text
2. Click the link icon (üîó) in the toolbar
3. Enter the URL
4. The link will be properly rendered in the article

#### **Photo Cropping Issues**
**How to fix image cropping:**
1. In Sanity, when uploading images, click on the image
2. Use the "Hotspot" tool to set the focal point
3. Use the "Crop" tool to adjust the visible area
4. This ensures important parts of images aren't cropped out

#### **Deleting Blog Posts**
**How to delete posts in Sanity:**
1. Go to your Sanity Studio (`/studio`)

5. Click the three dots menu (‚ãØ) in the top right
6. Select "Delete"
7. Confirm the deletion

### 5. **Color and Field Parameters**

#### **Color Fields in Sanity:**
- Use hex values: `#FF0000` (red), `#00FF00` (green), `#0000FF` (blue)
- Use color names: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `black`, `white`
- Use RGB: `rgb(255, 0, 0)` for red
- Use HSL: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` for red

#### **Common Field Types:**
- **Text**: Short text input
- **String**: Single line text
- **Text**: Multi-line text
- **Number**: Numeric values
- **Boolean**: True/false checkbox

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
